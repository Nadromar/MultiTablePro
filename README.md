# MultiTable Pro

## Discontinued
This application became redundant near it's completion due to sudden changes on both supported platforms.

The amount of tables you can have open on PokerStars was reduced from 24 down to 6 and Party/bwin no longer allows huds making mass-multitabling unprofitable on any stake with the possible exception of 2NL.

You are free to modify and redistribute this software. I've made it relatively easy to add support for other platforms.

Unfortunately I can't do this myself or assist with it since these are the only two platforms that are both legal in my country and allow third party software to be used. 

**DISCLAIMER:** 
- **Use this repository at your own risk. Anything you choose to do with it is entirely your responsibility.**
- **I cannot be held responsible for any penalties or loss of accounts on any platform.**
- **I cannot be held responsible for any financial or emotional damage cause by the usage of anything relating to this repository.**

**WARNING:** This application is not fully completed and has some platform specific bugs related to table placement. Table detection is also likely to be outdated and may need to be modified to work with the current version of the platforms.

MultiTablePro was reviewed and approved by PokerStars under their **April 2019 Terms of Service** in it's current state. Keep in mind that they likely **changed their ToS since then**!

It has however, **NOT** been submitted for approval to bwin/party. You'll need to verify that you have permission there for yourself.
You will need to do your own research on the platform you intend to use this on to see if you're allowed to use it. 

**Each platform has their own rules regarding third party software. These rules can change at any time and you are responsible for ensuring that you are allowed to use this software.**

#### Automatically Move Tables
MultiTable Pro moves your poker tables to the best possible position. Tables which require you to act become larger, while inactive poker tables are moved to smaller slots.

This will help you make more profitable plays on more tables without having to spend valuable time worrying about the logistics.


#### Custom Profiles
Create custom profiles to support your computer setup. Choose where priority and inactive tables will be placed on your screen. It also supports multiple monitors.


#### Move Priority Tables Aside
If you've every played more than 4 tables you probably know what it's like to be stuck on a hand while other tables keep piling up.

With MultiTable Pro you can just press a button which moves your table aside while continuing to play on other tables while you consider the best course of action for your aside table.

When you're done, you can simply press the hotkey again to move it back into the normal rotation.
