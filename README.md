# MultiTable Pro

## Discontinued
This application became redundant near it's completion due to sudden changes on both supported platforms.

The amount of tables you can have open on PokerStars was reduced from 24 down to 6 and Party/bwin no longer allows huds making mass-multitabling unprofitable on any stake with the possible exception of 2NL.

You are free to modify and redistribute this software. I've made it relatively easy to add support for other platforms.

Unfortunately I can't do this myself or assist with it since these are the only two platforms that are both legal in my country and allow third party software to be used.

- **I cannot be held responsible for any financial or emotional damage cause by the usage of anything relating to this repository.**

**WARNING:** This application is not fully completed and has some platform specific bugs related to table placement. Table detection is also likely to be outdated and may need to be modified to work with the current version of the platforms.

MultiTablePro was reviewed and approved by PokerStars under their **April 2019 Terms of Service** in it's current state. Keep in mind that they likely **changed their ToS since then**!

It has however, **NOT** been submitted for approval to bwin/party. You'll need to verify that you have permission there for yourself.
You will need to do your own research on the platform you intend to use this on to see if you're allowed to use it. 

**Each platform has their own rules regarding third party software. These rules can change at any time and you are responsible for ensuring that you are allowed to use this software.**
